Generalized National Airspace Trajectory-Prediction System (GNATS)
Version: Production 2.0 Linux Distribution

Changes in this release:
1. Simulation capabilities to support the In-Time Risk Assessment (IRA) concept have been added.

2. Models for 13 Aviation Occurrence Categories (AOC) have been added, details are given at Documentation/IRA AOC Manual.pdf.

3. RiskMeasureInterface has been augmented with new functions to permit the calculations of rate of change of aircraft parameters used in risk assessment.

4. Region-of-Regard and the Region-of-Interest computations have been incorporated to limit the computational effort in computations involving the motion of multiple aircraft.

5. An interface function to the aircraft database "ADBInterface function" has been added.

6. A test airtraffic data set consisting of 2-hour traffic in the San Francisco, San Jose, and Oakland area has been provided to enable the evaluation of the new In-Time Risk Assessment concept.

7. Support for Python 3.7 has been added.
