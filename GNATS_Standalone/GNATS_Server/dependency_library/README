NATS Dependency Library

NATS Server distribution can run without installing these dependency.

Please run NATS Server first to see if it's running.

Due to different Linux versions and other related libraries, NATS Server may not start.  If it fails, you need to install it individually.


1. Jasper
   We have tested the software with v1.900.1(Please see directory "dependency_library")
   You can use the dependency_library/install_jasper.sh to install it.
   
   Copy dist/jasper/lib/libjasper.a to dist/
   Copy dist/jasper/lib/libjasper.la to dist/

2. Grib API
   We have tested the software with v1.11.0(Please see directory "dependency_library")
   You can use dependency_library/install_grib.sh to install it.
   
   Copy dist/grib_api/lib/libgrib_api.so.0.0.0 to dist/
   Rename dist/libgrib_api.so.0.0.0 to be dist/libgrib_api.so
   In dist folder, create a symbol link.
   		cd dist
   		ln -s libgrib_api.so libgrib_api.so.0

3. HDF5
   We have tested the software with v1.8.21

   There are two ways to get HDF5 library.
   A. Use pre-compiled library
      Please refer to the "Using NATS Pre-compiled Dependency Libraries" below.
   B. Build it fresh
      Enter "dependency_library" directory.
      Read README_Install_HDF5 file.  It's a working procedure based on our experience.  However, it is not guaranteed to suit all Linux platforms.
      You can use dependency_library/install_hdf5.sh to install it from scratch.

   After you finish method A or B, we need to move some files.
   
   Copy dist/hdf5/lib/libhdf5.so.10.3.2 to dist/
   Rename dist/libhdf5.so.10.3.2 to dist/libhdf5.so
   In dist folder, create a symbol link.
   		cd dist
   		ln -s libhdf5.so libhdf5.so.10
