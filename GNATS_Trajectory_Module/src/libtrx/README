libtrx - TRX and MFL parsing library

This library is used for parsing OLD NATS TRX files and MFL files.

The TRX file contains flight plans.
The MFL file contains the Maximum Flight Level for each flight in the TRX file.

NATS has since been updated to use a TRX file which includes the MFL data.
However, at the time of this development, OSI was still using old TRX files
with separate MFL files. In the future, the TRX and MFL files should be
combined and this library should be updated to read the combined file.
