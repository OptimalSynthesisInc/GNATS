liblektor

c/c++ library for encrypting/decrypting files using the 256-bit AES algorithm.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IMPORTANT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The encryption key is hard-coded in the source of crypto.c.  We do
this so that the library functions like the libsysdata.a library
used by NATS to load its encrypted data files.  This means that
any file encrypted with this library will be tied to the specific
version of the library that it was encoded with.  If you change the
encryption key in crypto.c it will not be able to open files that
were incrypted with a different key.

DO NOT DISTRIBUTE THE SOURCE FOR crypto.c!
