wind_tool - README


wind_tool is a utility function to generate a RUC/RAP based wind input
file for the tg program.

tg_make_wind uses the GRIB_API from ECMWF to parse grib files and extract
the U and V wind components and the Geopotential Height.  

The goal is to support multiple output file formats.  Initially we will
support a plain text file, but in the future we would like something
like HDF5 as well.

Usage:

  wind_tool --filename-template=[string] --grib-dir=[directory] --outfile=[file]

Inputs:

Filename template:
  All RUC/RAP files in the input directory MUST have the same file name
  format.  For example, files downloaded from NOAA 
  (http://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/products/rap/) typically have the format:
  rap.tHHz.awpGGGpgrbfFF.grib2.  Here, HH is the hour of the day [00,23],
  GGG indicates the grid resolution (130: 13km grid, 252: 20km grid), and
  FF indicates the forecast hour [00,23].  Whatever the filename structure
  is for the input dataset, it MUST contain the HH, GGG, and FF fields.
  These fields are used for sorting within the program.


RUC/RAP Files:
  The user must supply a directory containing a set of RUC/RAP files.  We
  leave it up to the user to ensure that the input data set is sane.  The
  input directory can contain a combination of now-cast and forecast files.
  The user must ensure that the data set is consistent.  Don't mix RUC/RAP
  grid resolutions or GRIB1/GRIB2 types within the same data set.

Outputs:
  tg compatible wind file containing u-v wind components for each level
  in the RUC/RAP files.
