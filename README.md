# GNATS

GNATS has been tested and run on Linux versions Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial Xerus) and above.

Generalized National Airspace Traffic Simulation (GNATS) software can be used formulate gate-to-gate trajectory simulation involving multiple flight vehicles in a national airspace system. Simulations can be formulated using Python, C/C++, Java, MATLAB, Scilab, GNU Octave, or R programming languages. Vehicle performance-based point-mass models, spherical-earth geometry, airport and airspace definitions form the basis for the simulations. Optionally, Pilot and Controller models can be included. Detailed User Manual is provided.
